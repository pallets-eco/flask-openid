Flask-OpenID
============

Adds support for OpenID to flask applications.  Check out the
example for more information.

Documentation: http://packages.python.org/Flask-OpenID/

Note that this library is for a very old and outdated version of OpenID.
Almost no-one uses this Open ID protocol, the OpenID Connect protocol is
the current standard.
